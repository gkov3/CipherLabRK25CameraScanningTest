# CipherLabRK25CameraScanningTest
Demonstrate camera freezing on CipherLab RK25

The project is written in C# / Xamarin.Forms.

On RK25 after couple of scans the camera freezes and app crashes.

Works on other Android devices. Tested on

Nexus 6   (Android 6)

Nokia 6.1 (Android 10)

RK25 has latest available system update installed at the time of writing this (RK25.gms.5250.20210415)

Hopefully the project will help find the exact cause.
